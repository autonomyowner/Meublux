# Website Issues Found and Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Missing Public Assets
**Problem**: The website was referencing favicon files, manifest, and Open Graph image that didn't exist in the public directory.

**Files Missing**:
- `/favicon.ico`
- `/favicon-16x16.png`
- `/favicon-32x32.png`
- `/apple-touch-icon.png`
- `/og-image.jpg`
- `/site.webmanifest`

**Solution**: Created the missing public directory and all required assets with proper placeholders.

### 2. Missing Public Directory
**Problem**: The project structure was missing the `public` directory entirely.

**Solution**: Created the `public` directory and added all necessary assets.

### 3. Web App Manifest
**Problem**: The layout.tsx was referencing a web app manifest that didn't exist.

**Solution**: Created `public/site.webmanifest` with proper configuration for the Ikhlas Automobiles website.

## Recommendations for Production

### 1. Replace Placeholder Assets
The following files need to be replaced with actual images:

- `public/favicon.ico` - Create a 16x16 or 32x32 ICO file
- `public/favicon-16x16.png` - Create a 16x16 PNG file
- `public/favicon-32x32.png` - Create a 32x32 PNG file
- `public/apple-touch-icon.png` - Create a 180x180 PNG file
- `public/og-image.jpg` - Create a 1200x630 JPG file

### 2. Brand Guidelines
All favicon and icon files should use the brand colors:
- Primary Gold: `#D4AF37`
- Primary Black: `#0A0A0A`

### 3. Content Updates
Consider updating:
- Google verification code in layout.tsx (currently placeholder)
- Social media links in footer (currently placeholder)
- Contact information verification
